# PDF Merger
A simple GUI program for merging two PDFs into one.

While PyPDF2 makes it very easy to merge PDFs on the command line, I wanted a quick and easy way to do it using a GUI program. Also, by doing this locally as opposed to using a free web-based PDF merger, you can ensure with 100% certainty that no one is stealing data from you.

## Compilation
This can be run by running ````python main.py```` from the command line, or compiled via PyInstaller by running ````python build.py````. Note that this will download any packages in ````requirements.txt```` if you do not already have them installed. The executable will be located in the ````dist```` folder which will be generated by PyInstaller.
