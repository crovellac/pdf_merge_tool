# PDF Merger
A simple GUI program for merging two PDFs into one.


## Compilation
This can be run by running ````python main.py```` from the command line, or compiled via pyinstaller by running ````python build.py````. Note that this will download any packages in ````requirements.txt```` if you do not already have them installed.
