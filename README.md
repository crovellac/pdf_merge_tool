# PDF Merger
A simple GUI program for merging two PDFs into one.


## Compilation
This can be run by running ````python main.py```` from the command line, or compiled via PyInstaller by running ````python build.py````. Note that this will download any packages in ````requirements.txt```` if you do not already have them installed. The executable will be located in the ````dist```` folder which will be generated by PyInstaller.
